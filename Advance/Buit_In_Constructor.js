// Buit in constructor  also known as native constructor  , or standard constructor provided by the js that allows you to create objects of various data types.
// These constructors are available globally and do not need to be explicitly defined .
// They provide a convenient way to create instances of primitive data types and built in objects.

// basic example 
const num1 =new Number(1);
console.log(num1, typeof(num1));

const str1 =new String("RamAlagar")
console.log(str1);

const bool = new Boolean(true);
console.log(bool);

const array = new Array (1,2,3,4,5);
